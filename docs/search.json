We can also see countries fighting others, such as in the case for Ukraine and Azerbaijan. Some root causes for IDPs include internal and external war as stated, but also include food shortages, local violence, water shortage, climate change, past wars’ effects, government change, and others. The data set originally includes other information, such as origin countries of refugees, their destination countries, etc.\nSources:\nTidyTuesday Source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2023/2023-08-22/readme.md\nThe Original Source of the Data: The TidyTuesday dataset does not provide specific links to its data sources, but the most precise sources they mention are as following: “Data from UNHCR’s annual statistical activities dating back to 1951.

Between the 1960s and 2000s, Russia was quite successful in their space launches, however, through the end of this timeframe, their space launches per year started to decrease. The rise in their space launches coincided with the Cold War, and the decline coincided with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. We can see that in the 1950s and 1960s, China sent no objects into space but as mass education and technology developed in China, it was gradually be able to send objects into space, taking over the lead from Russia in the mid-2010s. Russia’s rise from the 1960s to the 1980s looks sort of logistical, whereas China’s rise since the 1990s looks more exponential, however, it is too early to decide. The causes of these could be the major reasons behind space launches: militaristic and governmental reasons vs. more commercial oriented government backed reasons in Russia and China’s cases respectively.

    "text": "We will be analyzing a data set of Spotify songs up to 2020. The data set source can be found at the very bottom of the page. We will be looking at trends in how many songs there is expected to be in a given album depending on genre, and will be analyzing how song titles changed over the decades. To start, we import our data.\n\n\nShow source code\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2020-01-21')\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 4)\nspotify_songs &lt;- tuesdata$spotify_songs\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nLooking at trends of the expected number of songs per album\nFirst, let’s take a look at the average number of songs per album. A lot of artists put up “singles”; so, in order to remove them, we filter for number of songs over 1 per album. Oftentimes, the most mainstream albums come with 7 to 12 or 13 songs per album. However, the data shows that less number of songs is more common for albums. The most common instance is 2 songs per album, then 3, etc.. This could be caused by smaller artists also being featured on Spotify and them having usually no restriction on a minimum amount of songs per album, or having any concern to release a bunch of songs at one time (they can do this over time). We see that all genres are not too extremely off from each other in songs per album; however, we see noticeable differences. Where EDM has about 2.42 songs per album, rap has 3.15. This may possibly be caused by the more vibrant and less-lyrics based nature of EDM opposed to the lyrics-heavy nature of rap. Lack of lyrics may possibly constitute in having less songs in a given album as it is harder to produce unique music with the element of just electronic music and the absence of words. EDM also tends to have the highest number of covers out of any genre as it is easier to mix-match, partly due to its relative lack of lyrics and technological produce again; where covers are only popular with popular songs, automatically making less-popular songs less covered, meaning less songs per a given album.\n\n\nShow source code\navg_songs_per_album &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre, track_album_id) |&gt;\n  summarise(songs_per_album = n()) |&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  filter(songs_per_album &gt; 1) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_songs_per_album = mean(songs_per_album))\nprint(avg_songs_per_album)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  playlist_genre avg_songs_per_album\n  &lt;chr&gt;                        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 edm                           2.42\n2 latin                         2.82\n3 pop                           2.76\n4 r&b                           3.09\n5 rap                           3.16\n6 rock                          2.95\n\n\nNow, let’s plot the number of songs per album and their instances detailing genres. What this graph tells us different to the data table above is the quickness in decrease of number of instances as number of songs per album increases. Expectedly, EDM, with the red bars, decreases quite fast compared to other genders as we go more right on the x-axis. Rap has quite a slower decreasing curve. Perhaps another color one might catch is orange, which constitutes to R&B, having quite a close curve to that of rap. If we look at our data table above, we see that R&B has a value that is quite close to rap, which fulfills our expectations.\n\n\nShow source code\nsongs_per_album_per_genre &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre, track_album_id) |&gt;\n  summarise(songs_per_album = n()) |&gt;\n  filter(songs_per_album &gt; 1)\n\nggplot(songs_per_album_per_genre, aes(x = songs_per_album, fill = playlist_genre)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(y=..count..), stat = \"count\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Songs per Album\", y = \"Number of Instances of Albums\", \n       title = \"Albums by Number of Songs Included\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1.5, 8), breaks = 0:8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"red\",\"green\",\"blue\",\"orange\",\"purple\",\"cyan\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at trends of song titles’ lengths and genericnesses over time\nNow, let’s look at the length of song titles per genre. Here, we look at both a) the number of words in a song’s title by genre, b) the number of characters in a song’s title by genre. Although values are again close, we can see here that rap has both the lowest amount of words and length in terms of characters, and EDM has the highest. Using previous hypotheses, we can hypothesize that since EDM has less songs per album, the titles are more descriptive, the opposite for rap. Another hypothesis is since rap has a lot of words used in the song, the title should be less discriminating to the content, therefore more general, resulting in a shorter title. Again, these are all hypotethical ideas.\n\n\nShow source code\ntitle_lengths &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(track_name)) |&gt;\n  mutate(word_count = str_count(track_name, \"\\\\w+\"), title_charlength = str_length(str_extract_all(track_name,\"\\\\w+\"))) |&gt; \n  group_by(playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_word_count = mean(word_count), avg_title_length = mean(unlist(title_charlength)), total_songs = n())\nprint(title_lengths)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  playlist_genre avg_word_count avg_title_length total_songs\n  &lt;chr&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 edm                      3.48             29.6        6043\n2 latin                    3.04             25.5        5153\n3 pop                      3.20             26.5        5507\n4 r&b                      3.31             27.0        5431\n5 rap                      2.94             24.3        5743\n6 rock                     3.45             29.4        4951\n\n\nLooking at the number of words in songs over their release year, we can obtain the following graph for songs between 1970 and 2015. If we model with a linear regression line, we can see a stark decrease in word usage over the decades in song titles. A few reasons why this might be are the need for more unique titles as generic titles for songs have already been taken therefore the usage of more unique and concentrated words; the ease of marketing shorter titled songs; the ease of access to songs via web-streaming and industrialization in production processes resulting in the need of less “refined” titles. Either way, according to the data set, the decrease in number of words over the years is evident. From the 4.0 levels in the 1970s, we reach the 3.4 words per title levels in the 2010s. I have omitted pre-1970 and 2015-2020 data due to less data points during those years.\n\n\nShow source code\nsongstemp &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(track_name) & track_name!=\"\") |&gt;\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(substr(track_album_release_date, 1,4)), word_count = str_count(track_name, \"\\\\w+\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(year) & year&gt;=1970 & year&lt;=2015) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_word_count = mean(word_count), total_songs = n())\n\nggplot(songstemp, aes(x = year, y = avg_word_count)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 3) + \n  geom_line(color = \"red\", size = 1) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"darkblue\") + \n  labs(x = \"Song Release Year\", y = \"Average Word Count in Song Title\",\n       title = \"Average Number Words in Songs vs. their Release Year (1970-2015)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s take a look at a generic type of song titles: the word “the” followed by a singular random word (i.e. the song title is two words: “The __“). A famous song that immediately popped into my mind fitting this rule is”The Unforgiven” by Metallica. Let’s now search for the number of songs that fit this rule. We know from a previous data table that the average number of songs per genre is about 5000-6000. This leaves songs with the exact format of “The” and another word at around 1% over most genres. One genre standing out is Latin, which may be caused by Latin songs frequently having non-English therefore non-“The” titles.\n\n\nShow source code\nthe_songs &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(track_name)) |&gt;\n  mutate(the_anyword = str_detect(tolower(track_name), \"^the\\\\s{1}\\\\w+$\")) |&gt;\n  filter(the_anyword) |&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  summarise(the_songs_numberof = n())\nprint(the_songs)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  playlist_genre the_songs_numberof\n  &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;int&gt;\n1 edm                            59\n2 latin                          14\n3 pop                            55\n4 r&b                            39\n5 rap                            51\n6 rock                           64\n\n\n\n\nSource Used\nAccess at: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md. The source states that the data comes from Spotify’s API via the spotifyr package. Authors of the package are Charlie Thompson, Josiah Parry, Donal Phipps, and Tom Wolff. Kaylin Pavlik had a recent blogpost using the audio features to explore and classify songs. She used the spotifyr package to collect about 5000 songs from 6 main categories (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&B, Rap, & Rock) in creation of this data set. h/t to Jon Harmon & Neal Grantham."

I have omitted pre-1970 and 2015-2020 data due to less data points during those years.\n\n\nShow source code\nsongstemp &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(track_name) & track_name!=\"\") |&gt;\n  mutate(year = as.numeric(substr(track_album_release_date, 1,4)), word_count = str_count(track_name, \"\\\\w+\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(year) & year&gt;=1970 & year&lt;=2015) |&gt;\n  group_by(year) |&gt;\n  summarise(avg_word_count = mean(word_count), total_songs = n())\n\nggplot(songstemp, aes(x = year, y = avg_word_count)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"red\", size = 3) + \n  geom_line(color = \"red\", size = 1) + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"darkblue\") + \n  labs(x = \"Song Release Year\", y = \"Average Word Count in Song Title\",\n       title = \"Average Number Words in Songs vs. their Release Year (1970-2015)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s take a look at a generic type of song titles: the word “the” followed by a singular random word (i.e. the song title is two words: “The __“). A famous song that immediately popped into my mind fitting this rule is”The Unforgiven” by Metallica. Let’s now search for the number of songs that fit this rule. We know from a previous data table that the average number of songs per genre is about 5000-6000. This leaves songs with the exact format of “The” and another word at around 1% over most genres. One genre standing out is Latin, which may be caused by Latin songs frequently having non-English therefore non-“The” titles.\n\n\nShow source code\nthe_songs &lt;- spotify_songs |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(track_name)) |&gt;\n  mutate(the_anyword = str_detect(tolower(track_name), \"^the\\\\s{1}\\\\w+$\")) |&gt;\n  filter(the_anyword) |&gt;\n  group_by(playlist_genre) |&gt;\n  summarise(the_songs_numberof = n())\nprint(the_songs)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  playlist_genre the_songs_numberof\n  &lt;chr&gt;                       &lt;int&gt;\n1 edm                            59\n2 latin                          14\n3 pop                            55\n4 r&b                            39\n5 rap                            51\n6 rock                           64\n\n\n\n\nSource Used\nAccess at: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2020/2020-01-21/readme.md.

    "text": "Introduction\nThis analysis tests whether in the Summer Olympics, on a per athlete basis, a home advantage exists or not. This analysis builds on a TidyTuesday dataset, analyzing the 8 Summer Olympic hosts and their competing teams 7 times abroad and 1 time as host between 1988-2016. By contrasting the variable, average number of medal points per athlete for a given nation, with whether that nation was a host of the Summer Olympics at that instance of competition or not, we draw statistical conclusions regarding if a “Home Advantage” exists for olympic hosts. “Home Advantages” can greatly influence athletic performance and results in competitions. It is important to remember throughout this analysis that our “Home Advantage” is calculated on a per participating athlete basis. In this analysis, we in fact show that a statistical significance of “Home Disadvantage” exists on a per participating athlete basis.\n\n\nHypothesis and Dataset\nHypotheses:\nNull Hypothesis: Whether a country hosts the Summer Olympics or not does not have an effect on per capita medal wins for that country.\nAlternative Hypothesis: Whether a country hosts the Summer Olympics or not does have an effect on per capita medal wins for that country (either positively, resulting in an advantage, or negatively, resulting in a disadvantage).\nOur alternative hypothesis is that the null hypothesis is incorrect; however, in order to draw a possible more precise statistical conclusion, in the event our alternative hypothesis is shown to be true, we will also be calculating 2 different p-values in order to conclude if hosting the summer olympics yields better results on a per participating athlete basis or not (not just that it has a statistical significance).\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-08-06')\nolympics &lt;- tuesdata$olympics\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nHere is a small snapshot of the data set we are working with:\n\nolympics\n\n# A tibble: 271,116 × 15\n      id name     sex     age height weight team  noc   games  year season city \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1     1 A Dijia… M        24    180     80 China CHN   1992…  1992 Summer Barc…\n 2     2 A Lamusi M        23    170     60 China CHN   2012…  2012 Summer Lond…\n 3     3 Gunnar … M        24     NA     NA Denm… DEN   1920…  1920 Summer Antw…\n 4     4 Edgar L… M        34     NA     NA Denm… DEN   1900…  1900 Summer Paris\n 5     5 Christi… F        21    185     82 Neth… NED   1988…  1988 Winter Calg…\n 6     5 Christi… F        21    185     82 Neth… NED   1988…  1988 Winter Calg…\n 7     5 Christi… F        25    185     82 Neth… NED   1992…  1992 Winter Albe…\n 8     5 Christi… F        25    185     82 Neth… NED   1992…  1992 Winter Albe…\n 9     5 Christi… F        27    185     82 Neth… NED   1994…  1994 Winter Lill…\n10     5 Christi… F        27    185     82 Neth… NED   1994…  1994 Winter Lill…\n# ℹ 271,106 more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: sport &lt;chr&gt;, event &lt;chr&gt;, medal &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\nData Mutation\nLet us first mutate our data set so as to help us in investigating per capita medal wins per participating country, for the Summer Olympics. In this light, we will mutate the data set so that we have a column that has medal wins per participating athlete, so that countries sending more athletes are not advantaged on a per athlete basis. Regarding the weighting of medals, we will count bronze medals as 1 medal point, silver medals as 2, and gold as 3 in order to better highlight a possible advantage, if there is one, that a country might have. No medal (NA) means 0 medal points, and joint medals will be awarded as their respective full medal’s medal points to both athletes/teams. Furthermore, we will mutate our data set so that we only analyze Summer Olympics. We will also analyze Olympics from only 1988 in order to have one instance of hosting per country, as both the 1984 and 1996 Olympics were hosted by the US. We are also doing this as to not go into issues with countries having different names/changing territories. Our data set runs until 2016.\n\n# Selecting only Summer Olympics\nolympicsdata &lt;- olympics |&gt;\n  filter(season==\"Summer\")\n\n# Assigning medal point values\nolympicsdata &lt;- olympicsdata |&gt;\n  mutate(medal_points = case_when(medal==\"Gold\" ~ 3, medal==\"Silver\" ~ 2, medal==\"Bronze\" ~ 1, medal==\"NA\" ~ 0, TRUE ~ 0))\n\n#Selecting years from only 1988 to 2016\nolympicsdata &lt;- olympicsdata |&gt;\n  filter(year &gt;= 1988 & year &lt;= 2016)\n\n# Defining a function to change city names into their respective countries (as if they were in 2025) so that we can compare teams and countries for home-field advantage\nhostcitytocountry &lt;- function(olympicsdata, city) {\n  hostcitytocountry &lt;- data.frame(\n    city = c(\"Seoul\", \"Barcelona\", \"Atlanta\", \"Sydney\", \"Athina\", \"Beijing\", \"London\", \"Rio de Janeiro\"),\n    country = c(\"South Korea\", \"Spain\", \"United States\", \"Australia\", \"Greece\", \"China\", \"Great Britain\", \"Brazil\"))\n  updatedolympicsdata &lt;- olympicsdata |&gt;\n    left_join(hostcitytocountry, by = setNames(\"city\", city)) |&gt;\n    mutate(!!city := country) |&gt; select(-country) \n}\n\nolympicsdata &lt;- hostcitytocountry(olympicsdata, \"city\")\nolympicsdata\n\n# A tibble: 106,268 × 16\n      id name     sex     age height weight team  noc   games  year season city \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;\n 1     1 A Dijia… M        24    180   80   China CHN   1992…  1992 Summer Spain\n 2     2 A Lamusi M        23    170   60   China CHN   2012…  2012 Summer Grea…\n 3    12 Jyri Ta… M        31    172   70   Finl… FIN   2000…  2000 Summer Aust…\n 4    13 Minna M… F        30    159   55.5 Finl… FIN   1996…  1996 Summer Unit…\n 5    13 Minna M… F        34    159   55.5 Finl… FIN   2000…  2000 Summer Aust…\n 6    18 Timo An… M        31    189  130   Finl… FIN   2000…  2000 Summer Aust…\n 7    21 Ragnhil… F        27    163   NA   Norw… NOR   2008…  2008 Summer China\n 8    22 Andreea… F        22    170  125   Roma… ROU   2016…  2016 Summer Braz…\n 9    23 Fritz A… M        22    187   89   Norw… NOR   2000…  2000 Summer Aust…\n10    23 Fritz A… M        26    187   89   Norw… NOR   2004…  2004 Summer Gree…\n# ℹ 106,258 more rows\n# ℹ 4 more variables: sport &lt;chr&gt;, event &lt;chr&gt;, medal &lt;chr&gt;, medal_points &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nWe now have a data table easier to work with in light of our aim.

While doing a permutation test, we discard whether if the average_medal_points_per_athlete is by a host nation instance or not, and we randomize/shuffle (here 10000 times) to create a normal distribution of a case where average_medal_points_per_athlete randomly varied, but assuming host_or_not was not a factor.

In our case, looking at the values, we can conclude that there is a disadvantage relationship in our hypothesis, which we will get to now.\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom our data, we see that athletes who are qualified to the Olympics are 44.7% more likely, on average, to score a medal if their country is not the host for that year. Furthermore, according to our p-value calculation, our alternative hypothesis is shown in the disadvantaged direction, as we have reached a p-value of 0.0107, as this is less than the p-value of 0.05 generally accepted by the modern-day scientific institution (2025). This p-value looks at the probability that our data set might have randomly been on the left of the red line in the above graph. The advantaged direction would have looked at the right of the red line, which would obviously been an unacceptable conclusion.\nTo reiterate, we show that athletes who are qualified to the Olympics are 44.7% more likely, on average, to score a medal if their country is not the host for that year. This might seem counter-intuitive at first, as most research shows that in athletics a “Home Advantage” is quite significant. Factors such as fan support, fan or bureaucratic pressure on judges/referees, similar climate/sports hall conditions, similar cuisine, possible non-temporary stays during the competition all favor the home team. So, what might be the cause that we actually seem to have a “Home Disadvantage”?\nWe had established that our analysis was on a per athlete basis. It is most likely true, that all these factors are noticeably helping the home team. However, the home team also is generally allowed to bring a very significant amount of more athletes from its own nation than it can send abroad for another olympic competition, per se. This is possibly a combination of wildcard entrees being awarded to the host more often, pre-determined extra quotas for the host, and a big relief in budgeting for sponsoring athletes domestically and not internationally.\nOf course, assuming the supply of world-class athletes are limited, the home country will fill the rest of the spots with less-likely-world-class athletes. This likely will result in overall worse performance by those athletes. Furthermore, the number of medals stays the same regardless of how many athletes from a country compete. For all these reasons, due to the average quality of athletes going down as a result of lower qualifying standards due to a supply of more available positions, on a per athlete basis, hosts of Summer Olympics events are disadvantaged according to our data set. Our closest estimate, according to the cross-competitions of the 8 Summer Olympics hosts from 1988 to 2016 over this time interval, that athletes from these countries during this interval were 44.7% more likely, on average, to score a medal if their country was not the host for that year.\nWe have shown a statistical significance showing our alternate hypothesis that hosting a Summer Olympics does have a negative effect on the number medals earned per participating athlete capita. This is backed by a p-value of 0.0107.\n\n\nSources\nTidyTuesdayR package obtained from https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-08-06/readme.md.
