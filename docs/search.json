Between the 1960s and 2000s, Russia was quite successful in their space launches, however, through the end of this timeframe, their space launches per year started to decrease. The rise in their space launches coincided with the Cold War, and the decline coincided with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. We can see that in the 1950s and 1960s, China sent no objects into space but as mass education and technology developed in China, it was gradually be able to send objects into space, taking over the lead from Russia in the mid-2010s. Russia’s rise from the 1960s to the 1980s looks sort of logistical, whereas China’s rise since the 1990s looks more exponential, however, it is too early to decide. The causes of these could be the major reasons behind space launches: militaristic and governmental reasons vs. more commercial oriented government backed reasons in Russia and China’s cases respectively. The data set originally includes other countries and organizations around the world as well.\nSources:\nTidyTuesday source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-04-23/readme.md\nData Page: Annual number of objects launched into space”, part of the following publication: Edouard Mathieu and Max Roser (2022) - “Space Exploration and Satellites”.

We can see many countries which have a big refugee exflux to other countries (such as Syria and Afghanistan) are in the list, but more commonly we can see countries with internal conflicts which are not presently at the scale of a civil war. We can also see countries fighting others, such as in the case for Ukraine and Azerbaijan. Some root causes for IDPs include internal and external war as stated, but also include food shortages, local violence, water shortage, climate change, past wars’ effects, government change, and others. The data set originally includes other information, such as origin countries of refugees, their destination countries, etc.\nSources:\nTidyTuesday Source: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2023/2023-08-22/readme.md\nThe Original Source of the Data: The TidyTuesday dataset does not provide specific links to its data sources, but the most precise sources they mention are as following: “Data from UNHCR’s annual statistical activities dating back to 1951.

Data from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) on people displaced within their country due to conflict or violence.”"
